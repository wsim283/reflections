When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A good time to use a remote repository is when you either want to back up everything or collaborate with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there is potential loss of code if having git to automatically stay up to date with our remote repository.
Note that in order to update our remote repository we need to do commits and pushes. if Git constantly check and pull automatically from our remote repository,
then it is very difficult to do some work on future commits as the repository keeps on pulling. In addition to this, collabing with others do have similar issues.
So manually pulling changes offers more flexibilty.
